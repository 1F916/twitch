Please enter "Bugfix", "Improvement" or "Feature" here.
Features will only get included in new major and minor versions and should be based on the master branch,
while bugfixes will be released to `@latest` more quickly and should be based on the support branch of the current minor version, e.g. `support/4.1`.
Don't worry - bugfixes will also be merged back to master, if applicable.
