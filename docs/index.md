Welcome to the documentation of Twitch.js, a library for NodeJS and the browser that aims to provide an easy interface
to all of Twitch's programmatically available features such as the Twitch API, the chat and the PubSub interface.

Please feel free to browse the menu for the left and either get started with the library or check out all the different available classes.

## Submodules

As of v1.0, some functionality is now located in separate modules:

- [twitch-chat-client](https://d-fischer.github.io/twitch-chat-client) - connect to and interact with Twitch Chat
- [twitch-pubsub-client](https://d-fischer.github.io/twitch-pubsub-client) - listen to events using the Twitch PubSub interface
